# AnonChat
AnonChat is a multithreaded socket chat developed in Python utilizing AES-128 bit encryption to keep the chat anonymous and private. It is a desktop application that is based off the client-server model. The server side code can be executed on a server, and the client distributed to users. The users can connect by server IP address and password set in server configuration and communicate anonymously through encryption at transit. It is up to the server owner to take care of server logs.

AnonChat is in its very early development stages. It's not handling many edge cases, is a bit buggy, and is not the most secure. I wrote this application in one night to polish myself with Python before I applied to my last job.
